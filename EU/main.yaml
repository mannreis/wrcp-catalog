      title: ICON nextGEMS Cycle 4 simulation
      summary: "Coupled atmosphere-ocean simulation at 5km resolution in the ocean and 10km in the atmosphere. Run for 30 years starting in 2020. Fields were remapped to Healpix level 10 using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Lower levels were generated from this using conservative aggregation. Ocean data is available at healpix levels 0-10, atmosphere data at levels 0-9. PT15M contains selected 2D fields, PT3H adds atmospheric 3D fields and more 2D fields of atmosphere and ocean, P1D adds ocean 3D fields."

      title: ICON 2.5 km simulation
      summary: "Atmosphere-only simulation at 2.5 km resolution. Run for 1 year and 2 months starting in 2020. 3D data is generated on pressure levels as instantaneous values (mostly starting at 6-hourly (PT6H)). Means are calculated from the instantaneous values. 2D field means are calculated from the timestep level values. Fields were remapped to Healpix level 12 using nearest-neighbor interpolation. Lower levels were generated from this using conservative aggregation. Level 12 data was (mostly) deleted due to space constraints."
