      summary: |
        Coupled atmosphere-ocean simulation at 5km resolution in the ocean and 10km in the atmosphere. Run for 30 years starting in 2020.

          * Ocean data is available at healpix levels 0-10
          * Atmosphere data at levels 0-9. 
          * PT15M contains selected 2D fields, 
          * PT3H adds atmospheric 3D fields and more 2D fields of atmosphere and ocean
          * P1D adds ocean 3D fields.

        **Processing**
          * Fields were remapped to HEALPix level 10 using nearest-neighbor interpolation. 
          * Lower levels were generated from this using conservative aggregation.

      title: ICON 2.5 km simulation
      summary: |
        Atmosphere-only simulation at 2.5 km resolution. Run for 1 year and 2 months starting in 2020.

        [Visual overview of dataset](https://s3.eu-dkrz-1.dkrz.cloud/wrcp-hackathon/data/ICON/d3hp003.html)

        **Simulation**:
          * Source code: icon-mpim:feature-dy3ha-p-experiments at commit b9c9da5cef4e7faadf13c2fe213de0c990c94bf3
          * Horizontal grid: R2B10, 83,886,080 cells, nominal resolution dx = ~2.5 km
          * Vertical grid: 91 half levels, 90 full levels at mid height between upper and lower half level
          * Initial conditions: From IFS for date 2020-01-01T00:00:00Z
          * External data: 
            * SST and SIC as monthly mean fields pre-processed for usage in AMIP simulations
            * Well mixed greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC11, CFC12 as annual means
            * O3 simulated or prescribed from monthly and zonal mean fields

        **Simulation modifications**:
          * 2020-05-28T00:00:00Z: timestep atm: 20s -> 15s, ozone: prognostic -> external data, zmaxcloudy: 33km -> 22.5km. zmaxcloudy is the maximum height up to which cloud microphysics is computed.
          * 2020-06-05T00:00:00Z: timestep atm: 15s -> 20s
          * 2020-07-27T00:00:00Z: dt_atm: 20s -> 18s, dynamics substeps: 5 -> 6
          * 2020-08-04T00:00:00Z: dt_atm: 18s -> 20s, dynamics substeps: 6 -> 5

        **Processing**
          * Fields were remapped from the 2.5 km ICON grid to the Healpix grid with order 12 using the nearest-neighbor interpolation. Lower levels were generated from this Healpix order using conservative aggregation.
          * Level 12 data were deleted due to the disk space constraints.
          * 2D fields time means are calculated from each simulation timestep values.
          * 3D fields are generated on 30 pressure levels as instantaneous values starting at 6-hourly interval (PT6H). Time means are calculated from the instantaneous values.
          * Additionally, a 3D field `vor` on 3 pressure levels is available as instantaneous values starting at PT3H.
          * Water content of soil layers `mrso` is available as a 3D field with 5 soil levels starting from PT3H.
