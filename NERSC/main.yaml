      title: SCREAM CESS experiment 2D Hourly instantaneous Fields
      summary: |
        2-D Hourly instantaneous Fields from the SCREAM CESS experiment.
    
        **Resolutions**
          * Atmosphere data at levels 0-10 for 2D fields. 

        **Processing**
          * Fields were remapped to HEALPix level 10 using nearest-neighbor interpolation. 
          * Lower levels were generated from this using coarse-graining.
