         Atmosphere-land simulation at 3.75km grid spacing. Run from 2020-01-20 to 2020-03-05.

         **Resolutions**
           * All data is available at HEALPix levels 1-10 for 2D fields

         **Processing**
           * Fields were remapped to HEALPix level 10 using Delaunay triangulation. 
           * Lower levels were generated from this using coarse-graining.

        2D hourly average Fields from the WRF (Weather and Research Forecast) CONUS404 experiment, i.e. regional down-scaled WRF model simulation at 4km grid spacing. Simulations are run from 1979-10-01 to 2022-09-30, but the HEALPix subdataset is available from 2000-10-01 to 2020-09-30.
    
        **Resolutions**
          *  Seven 2D variables are available at HEALPix levels 7-10. 

        **Processing**

          * Then remapped to HEALPix level 10 using Delaunay triangulation. 
          * Lower levels were generated from this using coarse-graining.
